          "We map hooks on a simple grid: problem → escalation → reveal → proof → CTA. Each beat gets a time budget before we ever open a timeline. That discipline keeps edits tight and prevents the \"feature montage\" trap that kills retention on mobile.",

          "Grade is the final trust signal. Consistent contrast, controlled highlights, and a cohesive color world make DTC films feel editorial instead of templated. When grade matches the brand's physical packaging and site photography, the whole funnel feels like one studio made it.",
